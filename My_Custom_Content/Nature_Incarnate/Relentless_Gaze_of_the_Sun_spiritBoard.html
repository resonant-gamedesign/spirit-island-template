the Energy cost of the Power, and
1 Energy per previous use of the Power this turn
each time you Repeat the Power.

<em>(You may Repeat each Power Card multiple times, but its 1st Repeat costs 1 extra, its 2nd Repeat costs 2 extra, etc. Check if the origin has at least 3 {presence} when you target the Power the first time.)</em></special-rule></special-rules-container>

			Examples include: reclaim-all; reclaim-one; move-presence(1); gain-energy(2);
			Gaining Elements: gain-element(water,fire); gain-element(water,2);
			Adding Presence: add-presence(1); add-presence(1,jungle); add-presence(2,town,city,blight,or); add-presence(2,strife,city,and);
			
			Sub-Groups of Growth are possible (think Lure)
			Example: <sub-growth title="pick one of:" bordered>   here 'bordered' creates the double line border
