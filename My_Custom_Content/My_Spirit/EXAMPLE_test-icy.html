        Your {sacred-site} count as {badlands}. 
		All {badlands} in your lands increase defend by 1. If you have 2 or more {badlands} in a land, skip the first build action in that land each turn.

        Your Unique Powers, Growth options, and {presence} track can give you {star} elements. {star} elements work the same as all other elements except you may optionally make a snow element count as {air} or {water} instead for the rest of the turn. Your powers that deal damage also deal damage to {dahan}.

			Examples include: reclaim-all; reclaim-one; move-{presence}(1); gain-energy(2);
			Gaining Elements: gain-element(water,fire); gain-element(water,2);
			Adding {presence}: add-{presence}(1); add-{presence}(1,jungle); add-{presence}(2,town,city,blight,or); add-{presence}(2,strife,city,and);
